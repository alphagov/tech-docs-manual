# Tech docs template

The Tech docs template is a [middleman][mm] [template][mmt] that
you can use to build technical documentation using a GOV.UK style.

The project consists of 3 repositories:

- [alphagov/tech-docs-template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template): the middleman site generator used to generate new sites
- [alphagov/tech-docs-gem](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem): the gem used by generated sites to include HTML, CSS and JS
- [alphagov/tech-docs-manual](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-manual): the repo that generates the documentation you're looking at now

[mmt]: https://middlemanapp.com/advanced/project-templates

## Create a new site

You'll need [middleman][mm] installed, and its dependencies (Ruby). If you have Ruby v2.2.2 or newer installed you _should_ just be able to run `gem install middleman`. Installing or updating Ruby is outside the scope of this README.

From the command line run the following commands, substituting `my-new-project`
for the name of your new project:

```bash
middleman init my-new-project -T alphagov/tech-docs-template
```

This will run an interactive prompt where you can set basic configuration for
your project.

After installing, you can [further customise your site](#configuration-options).

### Hosting on GitHub Pages

You can host your tech-docs site on [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] via a custom domain, using the following procedure:

1. Build your site using `bundle exec middleman build --build-dir=docs`
1. Commit and push the `docs` directory to the `master` branch of your repository
1. Visit your repository's "Settings" page, and enable "GitHub Pages", choosing "master branch /docs folder" as the source option.
1. Using your DNS provider, set up a CNAME pointing your custom domain to `[your account].github.io`
1. Add the custom domain to the GitHub Pages settings of your repository

Your documentation should now be viewable and searchable at:

`https://[your account].github.io`

NB: You must use a custom domain for your site. By default, GitHub Pages serves your content from a sub-folder, i.e. `https://[your account].github.io/[your repository]` Currently, tech-docs only supports serving content from `/`, the root of the web host, hence the requirement for a custom domain.

## Update a site

If you want to upgrade to the latest version run the following:

```
bundle update govuk_tech_docs
```

This will make the site use the latest version of the [govuk_tech_docs gem](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem).

The [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) in the gem should tell you what changed.
