# Tech docs template

The Tech docs template is a [middleman][mm] [template][mmt] that
you can use to build technical documentation using a GOV.UK style.

The project consists of 3 repositories:

- [alphagov/tech-docs-template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template): the middleman site generator used to generate new sites
- [alphagov/tech-docs-gem](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem): the gem used by generated sites to include HTML, CSS and JS
- [alphagov/tech-docs-manual](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-manual): the repo that generates the documentation you're looking at now

## Usage

### Create a new site

You'll need [middleman][mm] installed, and its dependencies (Ruby). If you have Ruby v2.2.2 or newer installed you _should_ just be able to run `gem install middleman`. Installing or updating Ruby is outside the scope of this README.

From the command line run the following commands, substituting `my-new-project`
for the name of your new project:

```bash
middleman init my-new-project -T alphagov/tech-docs-template
```

This will run an interactive prompt where you can set basic configuration for
your project.

After installing, you can [further customise your site](#configuration-options).

### Update a site

If you want to upgrade to the latest version run the following:

```
bundle update govuk_tech_docs
```

This will make the site use the latest version of the [govuk_tech_docs gem](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem).

The [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) in the gem should tell you what changed.

### Configuration options

<%= template_configuration_options %>

## Developing the template

### Local development

If you make changes to the template you can create a test site with this command.
Make sure that you've committed your changes first, because Middleman works with Git.

```
bundle install
bundle exec middleman init tmp/test-run -T file://$(pwd)
cd tmp/test-run
bundle exec middleman server
```

Your generated site should appear on <http://localhost:4567>.
